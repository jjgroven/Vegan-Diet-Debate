News,pos,The vision I want people to understand that vegan food isn t just for a select few It s an inclusive eating style Reaching beyond the vegan community is essential for creating a vegan friendly world Azumi Yamanaka a vegan activist in Tokyo The spotlight When you think of Japanese cuisine your mind might go straight to sushi Or pork ramen Or if you re a little fancy maybe Kobe beef The country is famous for top of the line meat and fresh fish But did you know that for years meat eating was banned in the country An emperor ended the ban In the late s as part of an effort to Westernize and open the island nation up to the world against protests from Buddhist monks that eating meat amounted to destroying the soul of the Japanese people The result A rapid rise in consumption of meat egg and dairy products Eating meat became a symbol of power and status and eventually the cultural norm Today Japan ranks th in global beef consumption and vegan options are difficult to find especially outside of major city centers Two hundred years ago plant based eating in Japan had a lot to do with religion and practicality But today some advocates are trying to renew the country s interest in veganism for climate and animal welfare concerns Grist fellow Sachi Kitajima Mulkey is Japanese and American and spent years living in Kyoto where her family is When you re an American living in Japan your friends visit all the time They re so stoked to have a free place to stay she said adding that many of her American friends were vegetarian or vegan And I just remember how hard it was she said Meat eggs and dairy were difficult to avoid not to mention the dashi or fish broth that forms the base of many dishes But then something shifted Around five years ago she started noticing vegan products at the stores and restaurants she went to Almond milk was suddenly available when it wasn t before she recalled Earlier this month she teamed up with Grist s Joseph Winters to write a feature on the rise of veganism in Japan Interestingly the push to include more vegan options in restaurants and supermarkets seems to be fueled in part again by the country s desire to cater to outsiders A lot of the new vegan initiatives are driven by an increase in tourism and trying to accommodate tourists Winters said For instance in the lead up to the Olympics in Tokyo which wound up being held in the summer of the government developed a set of guidelines and certification marks to help restaurants offer more vegan options for visitors and even offered subsidies for them But the push to increase plant based options is also a part of meeting national and local climate goals Japan has pledged to halve emissions by In the city of Kyoto which has its own aggressive emissions targets plant based eating is part of the plan to get there Still barriers exist for Japanese residents who want to go vegan Some mirror the barriers that many face in the U S a lack of accessible options and a stigma that meat free diets are not nutritious but some are also unique to Japan s customs It is a culture where bucking the norm is really looked down upon Mulkey said It s very difficult to feel like you re asking for any kind of special accommodations It s all about humility and the group and fitting in Mulkey even experienced this herself when she was home visiting family and reporting the story She tried to eat vegan as much as she could but was concerned about offending her loved ones by turning down meat or inconveniencing them by dragging them to yet another vegan restaurant Winters joked that this is often what it s like traveling as a vegan It just becomes a food travel experience he said You have your list of all of the sights and it s just vegan restaurants and then like OK I guess we ll go see the Sistine Chapel or whatever As far as the impact of the story Winters hopes that reporting on veganism and the way it s showing up in different parts of the world can help make the idea more accessible for people And Mulkey noted that she was particularly excited to frame the story with a Japanese audience in mind the piece was co published with The Japan Times It s exciting to see a culture that is so slow to change kind of move quite quickly on this actually she said It is nice to think that in a moment where the country does want to open itself up for more travel and have people visit it can accommodate people more In the excerpt below Mulkey and Winters delve into the history of Japan s relationship with meat and also what vegan advocates and chefs are cooking up and working against today Check out the full piece on the Grist site here Claire Elise Thompson In meat and fish loving Japan veganism is making a comeback Excerpt All is quiet at a m on a Thursday in Shibuya Tokyo s famous commercial district In an alleyway just steps from one of the busiest train stations in the world a short line of tourists huddles outside of a bar Finally half an hour later the door cracks open and greeted with a soft irasshaimase or welcome the parties shuffle in to sample one of the rarest dishes in Japan faux fish

everything from ramen to okonomiyaki a savory cabbage and pork pancake And then there s the fish served raw in sushi and sashimi grilled as fillets fried in tempura shaved as a garnish and present in nearly all other dishes as dashi a savory broth made of dried tuna flakes and kelp Maeda became a vegan six years ago due to her growing concern over environmental and animal rights issues It s a familiar origin story for those who have come to defy the typical Japanese diet by giving up animal products In terms of the vegan movement I think we re maybe behind other countries The number of vegans is very small Maeda says But there are more and more vegetarian and vegan restaurants in Tokyo I think because of tourists especially from countries with many vegetarian people Outside large cities like Tokyo Osaka and Kyoto vegan options quickly vanish In a culture that prizes convention and scrupulous attention to detail individual accommodations like vegan menu substitutions are often frowned upon And as in many other countries vegan options are sometimes stigmatized as less nutritious But recently things have been changing The anticipation of a tourism boom for the Olympics in Tokyo pushed the Japanese government to encourage new vegan businesses and menu options in major cities And in the years since restaurants like Maeda s have sprung up offering novel adaptations of traditional dishes Under pressure from Japan s pledge to nearly halve its carbon emissions by the government has also begun collaborating with vegan activists and advocates and awarding grants to alternative protein start ups Though challenges remain it s gotten easier and easier to go vegan in Japan over the last decade Climate issues and animal issues are growing Maeda said For me I can t imagine going back to eating meat again Convincing people to eat less meat is key to reaching international climate goals Up to percent of planet warming greenhouse gases emitted annually come from animal agriculture alone all the cows pigs lambs chickens and other animals not including fish that people raise for meat milk eggs and the like According to one study from the University of Oxford that looked at the diets of over people vegans defined as those who eschew all animal products create percent less climate pollution through their food choices than those who eat a meat heavy diet For most of the last two millennia the Japanese diet was a model of climate friendly eating due to Buddhist and Shinto objections to meat and dairy consumption although fish has long been a staple Beginning in A D meat eating was banned by official imperial decree The ban set the stage for the flourishing of sh jin ry ri a traditional cuisine that arrived in the sixth century along with Buddhism and aligns with the religion s prohibition against killing animals In the th century the cuisine developed into a spiritual movement focused on simplicity and balance between one s mind and body Sh jin ry ri literally means food for spiritual practice one Japanese studies professor told the BBC A typical sh jin ry ri set meal is vegan highlights seasonal produce and is designed around sets of five five colors five flavors and five cooking methods While it can still commonly be found in the dining halls of Buddhist temples modern chefs have taken sh jin ry ri into the mainstream including in Michelin starred restaurants where they emphasize the concept s focus on harmony with nature by using local ingredients and minimizing waste It wasn t until that Emperor Meiji lifted the meat eating ban seeking to usher in an era of Westernization Meat consumption grew quickly as domestic beef production boomed and animal products became a symbol of power and status As reports spread that Emperor Meiji drank milk twice a day dairy consumption became more popular too Today Japan ranks th in beef consumption globally and its per capita milk consumption is percent higher than that of the average East Asian country Japanese people buy eight times more meat than they did in the s and in families began eating it more than fish Japanese people still only eat half as much meat not including seafood as Americans But interest in plant based foods appears to be growing as it is in Western countries Japan s market for plant based foods tripled between and and the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries expects it to double again by These shifts have taken place as the Japanese population at large has expressed a readiness to shift toward plant based products for health animal welfare and climate related reasons according to a analysis in the Journal of Agricultural Management Although no official government statistic exists a survey found that percent of Japanese people identify as vegan a potentially higher percentage than in the United States where estimates range from to percent But even though vegan restaurants have been on the upswing since Japanese vegans seem to have fewer options than their American counterparts According to HappyCow a popular directory of vegan and vegetarian restaurant options Japan has fewer than six vegetarian restaurants per million people in Japan more than a fifth of them in Tokyo By comparison there are nine vegetarian restaurants per million people in the U S Even many chefs still don t know what vegan is they don t know the concept said Azumi Yamanaka a vegan activist in Tokyo She met with a reporter from Grist for a late lunch at Brown Rice a sleek vegan restaurant with an organic health focused menu near Harajuku the country s famous fashion capital For her meal she ordered the weekly teishoku special which came with a selection of small seasonal vegetable dishes rice and miso soup They don

has little interest in animal rights or environmental issues she said Yamanaka herself is an embodiment of a stylish urbanite with bright blue hair and strappy high heels which she wears even while riding a road bike studded with colorful stickers from environmental and vegan organizations Even if trendiness is an effective way to draw people toward plant based lifestyles Yamanaka said Japanese who commit to veganism are motivated by a variety of issues including sustainability and animal rights The country imports between and percent of its meat but depends on domestic factory farming to produce much of its dairy supply Its animal protection laws have been given low grades by international animal welfare organizations Other factors include the country s relatively high rate of lactose intolerance typical in Asian countries which some estimate affects the majority of the population Food allergies are also a factor for many of the country s vegan converts Between and the prevalence of allergies to eggs and milk along with peanuts and wheat nearly doubled among Japanese kids And eggs are the country s most common food allergy For over a decade Yamanaka has centered her life around freelance advocacy meeting with members of parliament speaking to government panels and consulting on plant based food options for large companies In she won an award in the animal rights category at the Japan Vegan Awards which were launched by a marketing association for plant based businesses in Yamanaka said city governments and companies don t care about expanding vegan options until they want to market to tourists They believe vegan products won t sell aren t understood or have failed in the past she said Many consider them only for foreign visitors Vegan croissants made with a soy butter on display at Universal Bakes a plant based bakery in Tokyo s trendy thrifting capital of Shimokitazawa Sachi Kitajima Mulkey Grist Tourism is certainly a huge economic factor in Japan In million foreign tourists entered the country outstripping the previous full year record by almost million Over a quarter of these tourists hail from neighboring parts of Asia with large vegan and vegetarian populations like Taiwan China and Singapore due to the widespread practice of Buddhism Before the vegan environment was not so good said Mayumi Muroya chair of the Japan Vegan Society the largest vegan and plant based industry organization in Japan The reality is that many of the foreigners visiting Japan are vegans and vegetarians And with the Olympics coming up in the government knew the number of visitors was going to increase hugely In the run up to the games which ultimately took place a year late and without crowds because of the COVID pandemic the Japanese government created food guidelines to help restaurants offer more vegan options and distributed subsidies to help them pay for those options In the government permitted two organizations to officially certify vegan products under the Japanese Agricultural Standards including Muroya s Adoption requires in person inspections and fewer than businesses have been certified A different nonprofit VegeProject Japan started unofficially certifying products as vegan in and its marker has become the most widely used vegan label in Japan showing up on instant curry pouches protein bars and some cosmetics Recently in an effort to make dining easier for tourists Tokyo began offering subsidies to vegan businesses with foreign language menus available that want to be certified with one of these labels the Japan Vegan Society s certification costs roughly Two hours away by bullet train the country s beloved and beleaguered tourism hub of Kyoto has also begun investing money into making the city s vegan options more visible both to accommodate foreign visitors and due to the city s pledge to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals These global goals were adopted by the United Nations in to end poverty address inequality and protect the planet prioritizing progress for the countries that are furthest behind Japan has used them as the basis for a public awareness campaign on climate change conservation and sustainability Despite its small stature Kyoto has long been considered an easier place to be vegan than the rest of the country As both the ancient former capital and a youthful university town the city is awash with historic businesses maintaining the traditions of a preindustrial Japan and a distinctly crunchy granola youth culture Although the population is a sixth of the size of Tokyo s it has half as many vegan options And recently the local government partnered with Kyoto Vegan an environmental organization that was founded in to expand and increase awareness of vegan options in the city The seeds of the group began four years earlier when local vegan advocate Chisayo Tamaki helped a group of tourists find a local izakaya with vegan options on the menu They settled for chilled tomatoes and tofu She started building a map to make it easier next time Chisayo Tamaki left stands next to a calligraphy painting her mother made Right Kyoto Vegan s headquarters are located on the small street Nij Castle a popular tourist landmark close to the city s busy downtown district Sachi Kitajima Mulkey Grist After the city asked if they could collaborate with me she said Kyoto Vegan receives most of its funding from a subsidy from the country s national tourism agency but it is also supported by the city as one of its Do You Kyoto projects The initiative aims to cut carbon emissions down to zero by the first local government in Japan to set such a target They can t achieve that goal without the support of vegan lifestyles said Tamaki She is also a member of the city s sustainability working group and has contributed to a slick city funded magazine project on climate friendly lifestyles In its plan to reduce its carbon footprint Kyoto considers veganism to be the th most effective way to cut down its emissions below expanding electric vehicle usage and above teleworking The private sector is helping to advance those goals For instance Plant Based Lifestyle Lab an initiative backed by a group of companies began in to promote and research plant based food technologies Last year a well known international ramen chain Ippudo launched a vegan menu option in collaboration with one of these member companies Fuji Oil For Tamaki it s a welcome change from just a few years ago when she was told vegans were wagamama a Japanese word that translates to demanding or picky Two friends catch up over lunch at Choice Kyoto a long standing vegan cafe serving Western style dishes in Gion the city s ancient entertainment district Sachi Kitajima Mulkey Grist In many ways people in Japan face the same barriers to veganism as anywhere else There are the logistical limitations the lack of options on restaurant menus and at grocery stores But there are also the psychological ones like the stigma of being considered wagamama exclusion from social activities and misinformation about health and nutrition In well known business mogul Takufumi Horie went viral for tweeting I think veganism is seriously bad for your health Research shows that well balanced vegan diets are healthy for most people as long as they take supplements to provide some vitamins and minerals In Muroya the chair of the Japan Vegan Society tried introducing monthly vegan lunches at an elementary school near Tokyo the first attempt of its kind in Japan Despite working with the school s nutritionist to design the menu Muroya s effort ran into barriers like the national school lunch calcium requirements which promote milk and pushback from parents worried their children wouldn t get adequate nourishment An article on BuzzFeed Japan about the controversy echoed the parents concerns questioning how vegan school lunches are good for the environment and citing the risk of missing nutrients Efforts to introduce vegan meal programs at schools in the U K Germany and France have encountered similar backlash Muroya s program lasted for only a year but she said the school still regularly does meat free Mondays Perhaps one of the biggest challenges to being vegan in Japan is the country s culture of conformity which considers standing out to be troublesome Having a different opinion from everybody else is very controversial Everybody wants to move together as a community Yamanaka said Some people fear coming out as vegan at school or work due to potential bullying Although she said she hasn t faced much adversity in recent years former coworkers pressured her to eat meat Ijime a term broadly used to refer to bullying in workplaces and schools is a persistent and sometimes dangerous problem that the government has tried to address Muroya said her dietary preferences became a professional problem at mandatory work events like end of year parties when caterers wouldn t accommodate her Even when I called in advance to warn the restaurant I was told I can t do that for you she said Maeda said she was motivated to find a job at a vegan company after years of limited options at her company cafeteria Mumokuteki a natural lifestyle store with a cafe serves up soy milk based ramen on its all vegan menu at its location on busy Teramachi Street in Kyoto Sachi Kitajima Mulkey Grist For Yamanaka the best way to make a more sustainable less meat intensive Japan is to bridge the gap between vegans and non vegans She said that when people discuss various issues that can motivate veganism like sustainability factory farming and allergies as well as the popularity of veganism among tourists more local governments and businesses can be convinced to make more options available Local plant based businesses are already making an effort to appeal to as many customers as possible At Universal Bakes a cult favorite plant based bakery in Tokyo s trendy Shimokitazawa neighborhood known for its vegan croissants and savory tarts the ethos is to provide allergen free food not necessarily animal free I want people to understand that vegan food isn t just for a select few It s an inclusive eating style Yamanaka said Reaching beyond the vegan community is essential for creating a vegan friendly world Correction This story originally misstated that the Japan Vegan Society was the first organization permitted to certify products under the Japanese Agricultural Standards It also mischaracterized the relationship between the city of Kyoto and the Plant Based Lifestyle Lab
News,neg,ADVERTISEMENT Healthy eating and nutrition are very sensitive topics and nearly everyone seems to have an opinion on them If you want to change someone s mind about embracing a healthier diet you have to be respectful and see them as your equal A holier than thou attitude and insults will only drive the other person away Besides nobody wants to be angrily talked at during a social event or family gathering Internet user u IFeelBad asked the AITA online group for a verdict on whether they were in the wrong for leaving their vegan sister in law Erin out of the family barbeque The reason The woman s incredibly aggressive attitude and non stop shaming of her relatives Scroll down for the full story two very important updates and to see how the net reacted to the spot of family drama Bored Panda has reached out to the author for comment and we ll update the article as soon as we hear back from them RELATED A good rule of thumb is to avoid intentionally causing a scene at family get togethers The dinner table isn t the place for hardcore fights Share icon Image credits Karolina Grabowska Unsplash not the actual photo A person asked the internet whether they were wrong not to invite their relative to a barbeque due to their over the top and militant vegan beliefs Share icon ADVERTISEMENT Share icon Share icon Image credits Sigmund Unsplash not the actual photo ADVERTISEMENT Share icon Image credits Blake Cheek Unsplash not the actual photo ADVERTISEMENT Share icon Image credits Nathan Dumlao Unsplash not the actual photo The host shared more information about the family drama later Share icon Image credits IFeelBad ADVERTISEMENT Before you start making radical changes to your diet talk to a healthcare professional And always be aware of what your body needs There are lots of general health diet and fitness guidelines that you can and should follow to live a better longer and higher quality life That being said you also have to take into consideration that your body s needs may not be quite the same as someone else s Different people have different lifestyles allergies genes nutritional deficiencies etc Just like you wouldn t encourage a person with lactose intolerance or a nut allergy to drink milk or eat peanuts you wouldn t push one particular diet on people who have very different relationships with exercise Similarly someone with a vitamin B or iron deficiency would focus on certain foods far more than an individual who has healthy levels of both in their system Supplements work but they have to be taken in conjunction with a balanced and nutritious diet Sometimes giving up red meat or seafood isn t an option from a dietary perspective even if you support veganism ethically There is no one size fits all approach though it s definitely a good idea to try to eat healthier move more stay hydrated get plenty of sleep and invest in your positive relationships ADVERTISEMENT So not only is it vital that you listen to what your body is telling you but you also shouldn t make any drastic changes in your lifestyle and diet without consulting your doctor or a health specialist What changes you make and how quickly you can introduce them into your life will depend on your goals Introducing a few more greens legumes seafood and fiber into your life while eating slightly less junk food is fairly easy to do Meanwhile moving past any deep seated addictions to sugar caffeine processed foods nicotine and alcohol will require far more time and effort to make your healthier habits stick And in some more serious cases you may need to make your lifestyle changes in sync with therapy so you can reframe your relationship with what you consume Generally omnivores are more accepting of vegans who avoid animal products due to to health concerns rather than ethical reasons Share icon Image credits Lauris Rozent ls Pexels not the actual photo The psychology behind the relationships between vegans omnivores and vegetarians is fascinating The BBC reports that many meat eaters find explanations for why eating animals is correct and part of their chain of thought is that they view vegans in a negative light ADVERTISEMENT Psychologist Julia Minson from the University of Pennsylvania studied attitudes towards vegans of participants had something negative to say about vegans social characteristics and included descriptions using words like weird arrogant preachy militant uptight stupid and somewhat bizarrely sadistic Meanwhile the BBC writes that non meat eaters tend to think they re better than other people For instance vegetarians tend to rate other vegetarians as more virtuous than non vegetarians And both omnivores and vegetarians tend to rate vegetarians as more virtuous yet less masculine than omnivores However the relationship between vegans and vegetarians can be quite tense too The former can think that the latter group is hypocritical Psychologist Benoit Monin from Stanford University said that vegetarians tend to be more threatened by vegans than non vegetarians actually are They vegetarians agree that there is something wrong about raising animals for food and now they re faced with someone who s putting their money where their mouth is more than they do Omnivores tend to find ethical vegans and vegetarians more irritating than people who avoid animal products for health reasons Meanwhile faced with cognitive dissonance and discomfort omnivores can react to pro vegan adverts that focus on animal suffering by eating more meat to justify their actions and lifestyles ADVERTISEMENT Cognitive dissonance is what happens when someone has two incompatible views in their head for instance eating meat but also caring about animals and acts in one way but not the other It can make the present feel stressed irritated and unhappy so they might lash out by blaming others If your goal is to change someone s perspective about food and health you can t act judgmental and holier than thou Share icon Image credits Nini FromParis Unsplash not the actual photo That being said you won t change many people s minds by being preachy or judging them Any good diplomat knows that you have to create a genuine connection with the other person Actively listen to them consider their perspective and be open to having an actual discussion with them If you blame someone for not eating meat or any other product they ll get defensive ignore you or lash out at you What you want is a genuine dialogue not a monologue where you show off how much better and morally upstanding you are than the people you supposedly care about Nobody likes a show off ADVERTISEMENT Then there s the issue of timing Shaming people about what they re eating at a family barbeque is ridiculous It s a get together that s meant to bring people closer not push them away If you have genuinely good recommendations for how someone can live longer and feel healthier you can always find a less public way of approaching those topics And in many cases actions speak far louder than words If you want to show off the benefits of veganism you can start to convince your family by cooking up some amazing dishes at the family barbeque To be blunt people love tasty food If it s nutritious on top of that it s a plus What are your thoughts about the entire family drama dear Pandas Have you ever not invited a relative or friend because they re overly passionate about one cause or another What do you think is a good way to broach the topic of healthier eating and living in the first place Has anyone whether a passionate vegan or over the top carnivore ever tried to browbeat you into changing your diet without caring what you think Grab a snack or a hot beverage and tell us what you think and what you ve experienced in the comments ADVERTISEMENT The author added even more context as the story started going viral Overwhelmingly the internet thought the author did the right thing by excluding their sister in law ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT A large chunk of readers thought that everyone was to blame and could have handled things far better ADVERTISEMENT Not everyone was on the same page A handful of internet users called the author out ADVERTISEMENT A bit later the author of the story shared a couple of important updates ADVERTISEMENT
News,neg,LEAN RED MEAT A gut healthy heart smart choice for a balanced diet study finds A Purdue University study shows that lean red meat consumed as part of a balanced diet can improve gut microbiota and cardiovascular health The study led by Dr Wayne Campbell found that including lean red meat in a healthy diet improved gut microbiota composition and reduced LDL cholesterol levels The research emphasized that the benefits were most pronounced with consistent long term adherence to a healthy diet rather than intermittent healthy eating Lean red meat is a rich source of essential nutrients like protein iron zinc and B vitamins which are crucial for energy immune function and overall health The study challenges extreme dietary trends advocating for a balanced approach that includes lean red meat alongside vegetables whole grains and healthy fats for optimal health In a world increasingly dominated by plant based diets and anti meat rhetoric a groundbreaking study from Purdue University offers a refreshing counterpoint lean red meat when consumed as part of a balanced diet can significantly benefit gut microbiota and cardiovascular health The findings published in Nutrients in challenge the narrative that red meat is inherently harmful and underscore the importance of dietary consistency for long term health The study Lean red meat and the gut heart connection The research led by Dr Wayne Campbell a professor of nutrition science at Purdue University examined the effects of dietary pattern cycling on gut microbiota and heart health Participants followed a healthy U S style diet that included three ounces of lean red meat such as beef or pork daily Over three controlled cycles researchers observed that each time participants adopted this diet their gut microbiota shifted to a more beneficial composition and cardiovascular markers including LDL cholesterol improved Each time participants adopted the healthy dietary pattern their gut microbiota shifted to a beneficial composition and cardiovascular markers such as LDL cholesterol showed improvement and were consistently linked with the changes in the gut bacteria Dr Campbell explained This study builds on a growing body of evidence that the gut microbiome plays a pivotal role in overall health particularly cardiovascular health The findings suggest that lean red meat often vilified in modern dietary discourse can be a valuable component of a balanced diet when consumed responsibly Consistency is key The case for long term dietary commitment One of the study s most striking revelations is the importance of consistency While intermittent healthy eating provided short term benefits these improvements were quickly reversed when participants returned to their habitual unrestricted diets Within weeks the positive changes in gut microbiota and cardiovascular markers disappeared It s better to consistently consume a healthy diet to support long term health outcomes Dr Campbell emphasized This is especially true if you already enjoy lean red meat daily as part of a healthy balanced diet This finding aligns with historical dietary wisdom For centuries traditional diets from the Mediterranean to the ancestral diets of indigenous cultures have included moderate amounts of lean meat alongside vegetables fruits and whole grains These diets were not only sustainable but also associated with lower rates of chronic disease The Purdue study reinforces the idea that modern health challenges may stem not from meat itself but from the overconsumption of processed foods and the abandonment of balanced eating habits Lean red meat A nutrient dense powerhouse Lean red meat is a rich source of essential nutrients including high quality protein iron zinc and B vitamins These nutrients are critical for energy production immune function and overall vitality The study s findings suggest that when consumed in moderation lean red meat can support gut health and cardiovascular function without the adverse effects often attributed to excessive meat consumption The research also highlights the importance of dietary patterns over isolated nutrients A diet that includes lean red meat alongside fiber rich vegetables whole grains and healthy fats creates a synergistic effect promoting a diverse and resilient gut microbiome This in turn supports heart health and overall well being Why this matters today In an era where dietary trends often swing to extremes from veganism to carnivore diets this study offers a balanced evidence based perspective It reminds us that demonizing entire food groups is neither scientifically sound nor practical Instead the focus should be on dietary patterns that prioritize nutrient density variety and consistency For conservatives and natural health advocates this research is a call to reclaim traditional dietary wisdom It challenges the notion that modern health problems can be solved by eliminating meat or adopting fad diets Instead it points to the timeless principle of moderation and balance As Dr Campbell s study demonstrates lean red meat is not the enemy When enjoyed as part of a balanced diet it can be a powerful ally in the quest for gut and heart health The key lies in consistency a principle that applies not only to diet but to life itself In a world of ever changing dietary advice perhaps the most revolutionary act is to return to the basics eat real food in moderation and stick with it Lean red meat it seems has earned its place at the table Sources include Expose com News Medical net

News,pos,What s Taking Up Your Mental Bandwidth Right Now Your mind is always pointed at something and it matters what it is If you spent most of your day preoccupied with thoughts about a past failed relationship for example that makes for a different kind of day than one in which you re preoccupied with solving a computer programming problem Your mood your actions and the tone and feel of your life depend hugely on what s on your mind As you know if you read this blog the mind can focus on things other than thoughts you can attend to present moment sense phenomena Even a few seconds of this at a time can break the momentum of thinking For the most part though if you re a human being living in the modern world chances are your attentional bandwidth is going to be dominated by thinking There s just too much in the environment drawing us into abstract world of thought Every glimpse of entertainment advertisement news gossip or content is a seed that can set off an open ended self sustaining weather system of thinking and feeling Passing a gas station you see that prices are up and within one second you re thinking of your household budget and other rising costs then inflation and politicians and that person you know who voted for the bad politician instead of the good one and so on Depending on how sticky the subject matter is for you and problems tend to be stickier than anything else this one glance at a sign can set a mood and theme that colors your whole day Seed clusters found in the wild We often inadvertently give these mental weather systems much more energy When a topic dominates your thoughts you might reinforce it by talking about it and consuming content about it creating fodder for more rumination triggering more content consumption and so on This pattern isn t strictly maladaptive if the topic really serves you If instead of becoming preoccupied with political talking points you became preoccupied with making a career change that preoccupation might steer your life in a great direction If you became preoccupied with banjo music instead of world events it might lead you to pull your banjo out of the closet learn some new licks download some banjo podcasts and join a banjo focused community Banjo music might not solve world hunger but this is still probably a better timeline for you than the one in which you re arguing with political wrongthink in your head to and from work every day You on an alternate timeline For each moment of your sixteen waking hours your mind is pointed at something If you had the data you could make a pie chart of attentional subjects just like one depicting app usage on a mobile phone You are spending some actual number of minutes and hours ruminating over workplace drama or the state of the world or your health troubles The makeup of this hypothetical pie chart has a direct effect not just on how life feels but on what you do and therefore where your life goes The Contents of Your Mind Drives the Contents of Your Life Here s a personal example I have a history of serial obsessions My mind will fixate on an intriguing topic and I ll dive into books films and podcasts about it for weeks or months I ve engaged in fruitful obsessions with blues guitar wine Cold War history veganism bodybuilding chess th century seafarers coffee brewing methods Lovecraftian horrors Buddhism Scotch whisky Stephen King s bibliography rock climbing and countless smaller interests that only held my mind for a week or two Dominant theme March to September How long a human mind gives a topic serious bandwidth depends on how magnetic it is to one s sensibilities but also how strongly you orient your habits towards cultivating that interest by consuming related content and bringing its paraphernalia thinking patterns and communities into your life A passing fancy for vintage clothing might change how you dress forever Watching a documentary on vegetarianism might change your diet and your health for the long term On a slow workday in I read a blog post that began a years long preoccupation with blogging and online entrepreneurship which led to the founding of this website and a complete change of my career and life path At the time I was constantly reading about those topics engaging in the relevant communities building things and planning future projects My mind was strongly attuned to the subject and it drove my habits I d get home from work and look forward to spending my evening hours making something This was great because it was driving my life in the direction I wanted to go towards independence creativity prosperity and connection with similar minds How frequently a man s life is changed by a vintage leather garment That was a long time ago For more than a decade now my interest in building a business and an online community has been far from the center of my mind I guess it s been filled with other things So what has been dominating my bandwidth the way entrepreneurship once did Lots of topics some of which I listed above But over the past few years at least without quite noticing it I ve become very preoccupied with political philosophy of all things In hindsight this interest has been driven by our wild online culture war the vicious and strangely dichotomous disagreement over COVID policy speech rights racism and weaponized accusations thereof and use of state power Something has seemed very unhealthy in the way people have been disagreeing over this past decade It s become so strongly ideological and partisan In order to make sense of where this comes from I ve jumped headlong into Lasch Hayek Marx Marcuse Sowell and a host of contemporary pundits Established in the free market of my attention By now I ve consumed massive amounts of content on the topic Between home the gym and my vehicle I ve been absorbing about three hours of audiobooks alone per day and of that is about political ideology I ve just been slamming them back in this way for the last three or four years This phase has been very informative and it s helped me understand the mass human craziness that seems to characterize the s But it s not good for me Rather than drive my creative abilities career and connection with other humans this interest has driven me to my phone into the bottomless ocean of ephemeral political hot takes Even when I m not absorbing content my head is swimming with political arguments maxims and talking points and generating new ones I don t need that Unfortunately I find the topic of political ideology fascinating Thoughts on how societies should be run drive so much of history There is certainly a place for it When your opinions finally become policy But right now I want to invest my bandwidth elsewhere I m trying to build something I think the world really needs a way for ADHDers and procrastinators to overcome the biggest problem in their lives and instead of filling my bandwidth with the ideas and skills needed to do that I m filling it with diatribes about economic policy and propaganda methods I have a chance to make life better for thousands or millions of people but if that s my goal I m misallocating my bandwidth Making a Deliberate Bandwidth Change The mind doesn t ask your permission before attending to something it will simply grasp what seems salient However you can change what it tends to grasp by curating the inputs On February I began an experiment For the months of February and March I ll be dumping politics from my attentional bandwidth as entirely as possible I m cutting off any inputs that draw the mind in that direction That means no news or political editorials no books on the topic and I ll avoid any discussions about politics or world events Very high band width It certainly means no browsing of social media Scrolling X or Bluesky or Threads is essentially browsing an endless rolodex of emotionally driven political stands Instead of pumping political ideas into my head every day I ll mostly be consuming content related to small business marketing and community building like I did back in the early s If my mind s going to be mulling over some problem I d rather it be how to get my best work out to a million people rather than how to express the hubris of socialist planned economies Early doomscrolling machine The Civic Duty Objection I need to address the inevitable civic duty objection that comes up whenever someone advocates ignoring politics for a while A responsible adult needs to know what s going on You can t just stick your head in the sand I share this moralistic feeling that by tuning out the news I m abdicating some important role of watchdog and opinion haver but I think the moral importance of that role mostly is an illusion It s a hobby or an addiction dressed up as a duty While it is technically possible for informed ordinary people to influence political outcomes that isn t really what we re doing by consuming massive quantities of content We re too easily convinced by those with far more influence over the proceedings that the amount of attention we invest in what they do is a measurement of our degree of participation We re spectators hooked on the spectacle Your civic duty is to hang off my every word Also any mental bandwidth taken up by politics is unavailable for anything else While you re doomscrolling news apps are you really investing everything you can in human connection creative work material prosperity spiritual realization or whatever else is important to you In any case this is a break not a lifelong renunciation Believe me I still have my opinions News avoider or news addict Which is sand and which is fresh air Follow the Experiment or join me I ll be keeping a public experiment log to detail my experience with this bandwidth swap campaign If you opt to do something similar whether with politics or any other bandwidth stealer you can share your insights in the comment section there What s occupying your mental bandwidth Is there something better you could be using it for Except what is strictly and practically necessary for my household decisions My country is currently dealing with the imposition of new US tariffs and I want to understand the implications so I m reading only about tariffs It s not fun

News,pos,There s a certain fan interaction that has been stuck in Harris Dickinson s mind To be sure Dickinson has been having more of these encounters recently with his seductive role in Babygirl opening the door to a very specific type of attention Women often older women approach the year old actor to offer explicit rundowns of their sexual desires Dickinson is too embarrassed to repeat most of these but says many involve his now signature utterance from the movie Good girl Photographed by Paola Kudacki But this morning Dickinson is thinking about an interaction that happened before Babygirl s release at an L A grocery store at least a year ago A fan approached him and asked Are you in that model movie a reference to s Triangle of Sadness in which Dickinson plays a male model on a doomed luxury yacht cruise Dickinson readied himself for the kind of praise that usually follows such questions What the fuck was up with that demanded the man who proceeded to aggressively pick apart the movie and Dickinson s acting abilities It was like Oh you think you re famous that people care about you Well I don t Dickinson recalls I almost like it when that happens because I get such a constant slew of You re amazing that it can be really interesting when someone is just like That was shit Triangle of Sadness was decidedly not shit it was Oscar nominated but that s beside Dickinson s point It s dawning on him that broader fame is coming for him and he s not sure he s ready for it When we first meet in December in New York he s at the tail end of a truncated whirlwind press tour for Babygirl an erotic thriller about an affair between a tech CEO Nicole Kidman and her much younger intern Dickinson that threatens her perfectly built business and family At Dickinson s hotel first thing in the morning he ambles downstairs balancing a backpack a tote bag and a large winter coat with a jet lag that the in room Nespresso has barely put a dent in The night before this I had a really bad shoulder and I m quite dramatic sometimes so I thought I had a torn ligament he says I was like I need to go to the doctor And then I woke up today and I m like OK it s fine He delivers these anecdotes in high spirits with a grin and a twinkle in his eye Oh how am I going to get through today he pleads at one point citing the THR photo shoot and a Late Night With Seth Meyers taping that still loom I guess I ll just be a big strong boy He vacillates between introspective and goofy you can see his appetite for taking himself too seriously evaporating in real time During breakfast he shows off a napkin folding trick he learned a few years ago when he was still working in a hotel doing room service kitchen shifts and setting up for weddings It was a really shit hotel he says with a laugh while using his teeth to put the final touches on a fan shape I know this looks kind of tacky but I think sometimes tacky is nice His role in Babygirl puts his disposition and his very specific position on the boy to man spectrum to good use Though director Halina Reijn didn t write the role for Dickinson specifically she says the movie wouldn t have worked without him Kidman signed on to the project in and instead of being happy about it Reijn woke up the next morning with a panic attack I thought How are we ever going to find someone who can be her equal much less dominate her she says That same week a friend persuaded the director to attend a screening of Triangle of Sadness an emetophobe she was wary of the movie s extended seasickness scene and as soon as she saw Dickinson onscreen she knew Then I went home and watched Beach Rats that same night and was like This is exactly what I need she says The boy and the man in one The father and the child in one person Even his height because I needed someone who could handle her physically Nicole Kidman and Harris Dickinson in Babygirl Courtesy of A Reijn then set up a Zoom to offer him the role It seemed to me like he sat in a closet she recalls with a laugh but he needed some time to think Dickinson says he was unsure how to play the role The script sees Samuel an intern at Kidman s robotics company as someone both authoritative and vulnerable who is grappling with his masculinity in real time On paper a lot of what he does propositioning his boss during a meeting sending her a glass of milk during a company party as a dare is inappropriate but he isn t meant to be lecherous and that delicate balance felt daunting Ultimately the opportunity to do something so high caliber won out though he never completely rid himself of his shyness Harris has talked before about being shy or unsure of how to play the character but I never felt that once as we made this project notes Kidman by email adding Harris is a brilliant actor I can t imagine doing this project with anyone else I know he s going to be a massive star Kidman was nominated for a Golden Globe for her Babygirl performance but despite considerable buzz the film was shut out of the Oscar nominations Dickinson maintains the shoot was far more anxiety ridden for him than it probably seemed to his co stars only made worse by his environs The production required him to move to New York for four months and the city weighed on him He lived in the East Village right on Houston Street and though he took constant advantage of the proximity to Katz s Deli and its world famous Reuben he couldn t handle the neighborhood s frenetic energy People were accidentally ringing my buzzer at night and I was in a constant state of stress he says My cortisol was so high that I felt like I was going to explode Prada leather coat V neck sweater pants Dickinson s own ring Artistic and Fashion Director Alison Edmond Photographed by Paola Kudacki Grooming Elle Favorule Set Design Happy Massee Fashion Assistants Morgan Lipsiner Marley Pearson Dickinson s working class upbringing in East London is a huge influence for the way he moves through the world and Hollywood He was born in and grew up in an environment that could be both bucolic he s big on hearing birds in the morning and chaotic he is the youngest of four siblings His parents divorced when he was in elementary school and his mother raised them all while cutting hair in the family kitchen to pay the bills My daily routine was coming downstairs and immediately being confronted by an elderly lady he says of his mother s clients They d all known me my whole life so I d just roll down in my underwear and be like You all right Susan and then squeeze around them as I made my cereal His father a social worker moved away and would often stay at a campsite when he came back to visit I d be like OK I m going to see my dad at his tent he says with an embarrassed roll of the eyes But now as I get older I m like You re fucking cool man Dickinson still lives in the same suburb now in his own house in an admittedly nicer neighborhood with his longtime partner indie pop musician Rose Gray and their cat Misty Dickinson met Gray during school and though she doesn t typically attend his public events Dickinson has directed a few of her music videos Even though he doesn t want the slew of children his mother raised he says just one likely will do though he s hesitant to say that in case I have four kids and then they read this and say Oh you only wanted one he feels comforted by re creating many of the vibes of his childhood My life is sort of half and half I m doing this very public facing stuff where I get picked up by drivers and treated very nicely and then there s this other part of my life where I m getting on the Tube in East London and someone spits on my shoe whilst eating a burger He started acting almost accidentally He loved pop culture from a young age he went through a phase of idolizing early Justin Bieber and used to lie on his bed listening to everything from James Blunt to Nirvana and pretending he was in a music video but he didn t think about acting until his mother put him in a public performing arts program as a way to keep him occupied He entertained joining the Royal Marines before deciding to try the thing he was learning he loved He spent a few fruitless years after high school auditioning for anything he could find occasionally making it to the final round only to lose out he read for the role in Ang Lee s Billy Lynn s Long Halftime Walk that eventually went to Joe Alwyn A yes eventually came in and at he went to New York to film Beach Rats a small indie film about a teenager exploring his sexuality in a decidedly not gay friendly community in Coney Island Dickinson played the lead Frankie adopting a Brooklyn accent and partway through the film a buzz cut At the time he entertained absolutely zero notions about what the movie might become He says he was so out of the loop about what mattered in Hollywood that even when the film was accepted to the Sundance Film Festival and even when it won awards in Park City he didn t glean the magnitude He didn t have a publicist so requests for things came through his agent and manager and he said yes somewhat indiscriminately W Magazine included him in their Great Performances portfolio and when he realized he was featured alongside Jennifer Lawrence Emma Stone and future co star Nicole Kidman I was like Fuck this is crazy I m getting asked to do this mad shit His team called to tell him he d been nominated for the Gothams and the Spirit Awards and he asked whether they thought he might be invited to go They were like Of course you ll be able to you re nominated for best leading actor you idiot he recalls with a laugh For the next few years jobs came steadily if not quite as loudly He joined the ensemble cast Amandla Stenberg Mandy Moore Bradley Whitford of the YA sci fi film The Darkest Minds which bombed but allowed him to meet actor Patrick Gibson The OA Dexter Original Sin who became one of his best friends and later starred in Dickinson s first short film the experience gave Dickinson the directing itch and he s working on his feature debut about a young drifter in London He played John Paul Getty III in Danny Boyle s miniseries Trust which introduced him to veganism the role called for him to get and stay quite thin and he kept up the diet for three years before giving it up and panic attacks the hours and the stress of playing a kidnapped kid grated He took roles in Maleficent Mistress of Evil and The King s Men for the chance to work alongside talent like Angelina Jolie and Ralph Fiennes Buck Mason white tee Tanner Fletcher brown pinstripe pants Eera necklace Prada v neck sweater pants Artistic and Fashion Director Alison Edmond Photographed by Paola Kudacki Grooming Elle Favorule Set Design Happy Massee Fashion Assistants Morgan Lipsiner Marley Pearson He also took those jobs quite frankly to work Dickinson is candid about the fact that his working class background afforded him no financial safety net I never had any grand expectations of a certain caliber of a career and I d gone from working in a hotel to getting work as an actor so I was just taking the jobs without thinking about what kind of career I had he says And that is very normal for most actors A few years ago he was on an indie film talking about simultaneously working on a big budget commercial film This actor on that art house film was like You have to only do things you love blah blah blah don t jeopardize your creative integrity blah blah blah but it doesn t work like that especially when you re a young actor he says I had taste but I couldn t be strict about things because I needed momentum Today he can be creatively picky but still doesn t feel like he can pick jobs without taking money into account He pays close attention to his lifestyle careful not to get wrapped up in the fancy cars and vacations for fear of feeling like he can t keep up I m scared of buying stuff I feel guilty he says When he was and the paycheck for Beach Rats came in he bought the small house he still lives in It was modest but it became my focus and this very grounding thing for me he says It was like OK I have to look after this and I have to fix stuff when it breaks I have to sort the garden out I still try to keep things simple When pressed he does admit to entertaining the idea of buying a motorbike but his friends and family so far have talked him out of it Dickinson as a closeted teen navigating his sexuality in the indie breakout Beach Rats Tayarisha Poe Neon Courtesy Everett Collection His turn in Triangle catapulted him into the rarefied set of young actors who can claim the mantle of offer only meaning they don t need to audition for roles When Brit Marling was packaging A Murder at the End of the World her long anticipated follow up to The OA she needed someone for the lead a former anarchist hacker turned successful artist with enough charm to convince the audience to care deeply about his episode one death After seeing Dickinson in Beach Rats then learning he was a Brit pulling off that role she offered him the job As a model on a doomed luxury yacht in the Oscar nominated Triangle of Sadness With few expectations for either film he says their impact taught him to trust in auteurs Fredrik Wenzel Plattform Neon When actors don t audition it puts more pressure on the first days on set filmmakers don t know exactly what to expect When rehearsals began on A Murder at the End of the World Marling put Dickinson and co star Emma Corrin meeting for the first time in an El Camino rehearsing a scene that called for them to sing Annie Lennox s No More I Love You s He has this trick where he starts a scene like that with just the right degree of making fun of it at first in this tongue in cheek way and then he really leans into it with feelings says Marling Then because he s so sincere it allowed Emma to be sincere and the audience can feel it wholeheartedly Reijn describes a similar alchemy on the Babygirl set You may have heard about Dickinson s shirtless dance to George Michael s Father Figure the director envisioned the scene with that exact song before she wrote a single word of the script making it all the more pivotal He s such a good mover and he s very masculine but what I love about it is that you can see he s also a little bit uncomfortable she says It makes it that much more human For those wondering the tattoos Dickinson exposes in that scene are his own he didn t think it would be a thing but then people started asking about everything emblazoned on his abs and arms He s too embarrassed to get into them he says but explains that the SKR emblazoned on his forearm is just the phonetic skirrr he delivers it with a roll of the tongue and a wave of his hand which he chose for no reason other than silliness Buck Mason white tee Eera necklace Artistic and Fashion Director Alison Edmond Photographed by Paola Kudacki Grooming Elle Favorule Set Design Happy Massee Fashion Assistants Morgan Lipsiner Marley Pearson Dickinson is rumored to have landed the extremely high profile John Lennon role in Sam Mendes series of Beatles biopics The director has a four film deal with Sony to tell the story of the band leading up to their s breakup with one movie dedicated to each member If the casting reports hold true Dickinson will play Lennon alongside Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney Joseph Quinn as George Harrison and Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr It s a career defining opportunity and Dickinson is already a little uneasy about the attention the project is garnering At one point during our time in New York I ask him Are you going to and he lets out an immediate groan Don t ask me about that he pleads before I can finish I was actually asking about Hot Ones not the Beatles project But a few weeks later he Zooms me from his kitchen while eating leftover rag and he offers a more dutiful response OK my comment is that I think it would be a brilliant opportunity to play John Lennon and to work with Sam and everyone else mentioned Yeah I don t know It would be splendid Jeremy Allen White who starred with Dickinson in s The Iron Claw and is filming the Bruce Springsteen biopic knows exactly what he s about to be going through Last summer White was in London to see Springsteen play Wembley Stadium as part of his research and had lunch with Dickinson the day after the concert I was expressing how much anxiety I was having and there are probably people in the world that I could have looked to in that moment to talk about how horrifying it was White says of the pressure of portraying a rock icon I was so grateful for him and if this movie comes together and he s able to play John Lennon I hope I can listen to him if he feels similar which I m sure he will because if you re confident going into something like that you re probably a little crazy Dickinson says he has safeguards in place to mitigate the potentially corroding nature of stardom His team is purposefully small one agent one manager one publicist and their directive is to respect his preferred slow pace On set he tells staffers not to do the usual waiting on hand and foot I can open my own doors and if I want a drink I ll go get my own drink he says You start to notice your own prissiness and I don t like that One thing he can t put a stop to is the constant flow of praise especially after all that shirtless slow motion gyrating so he s working through that too It s weird because I do have vanity like everyone else but I m not at ease with the emphasis being on that he says I don t want to get that mixed up with my self worth But there are worse things to be said to you than You re hot you know It s flattering It s strange I do think I ll probably look back on all this and be really grateful for the attention he concedes I ll put all the comments in a little book and then when I m and fat I ll read it all to reaffirm to myself that once upon a time people said nice things about me Prada cardigan pants Harris s own rings Artistic and Fashion Director Alison Edmond Photographed by Paola Kudacki Grooming Elle Favorule Set Design
